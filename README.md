This game was written as a project for me to explore game programming and Microsoft's XNA framework. It currently has one level
of which the goal is to get past the monster while dodging all the fireballs.

Planned features include:
* Customization screen to set custom fireball speed and spawn rate
* More elegant UI
* Additional maps/levels
